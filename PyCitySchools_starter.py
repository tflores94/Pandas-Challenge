# - Your analysis here
# 
# --- Throughout the assignment, I observed that mediumâ€”to smaller schools have a better percentage of students passing math and reading. I believe that the size of the school does matter when it comes to a student's education because the teacher can give more attention when needed to each student as opposed to a teacher who teaches a larger class.
# --- Throughout the assignment, I have also observed that the budget and the number of students for these schools are fairly the same. for example, if we look at Bailey High School and Griffin High School. Bailey has a count of 4,976 students and Griffin has 1,468 students. Bailey has a budget of $628.00 and Griffin has a budget of $625.00. You would think Bailey having more students than Griffin that their budget would be more. But throughout the data, it seems pretty consistent throughout all the schools no more the amount of students. I believe this could also affect the education the size of these schools are receiving based on budget. Fewer teachers if the budget is about the same as the medium to small schools.
